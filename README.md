# Rumor Simulation

This research was conducted with the help of Dr. Erin Bodine of Rhodes College.

I have created an agent-based model in NetLogo that simulates large-scale interactions at an individual's level. To do this, I developed algorithms that to model a rumor's diffusion and mutation over time. 

We collect data from the rumor's evolution and diffusion rates into an Excel spreadsheet.

The results are visualized in Wolfram Mathematica through sensitivity analyses, mutation fidelity plots, and diffusion density plots.
